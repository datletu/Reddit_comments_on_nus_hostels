Welcome to RH! 

commitment wise depends on how much u r willing/ able to contribute honestly. 

sports - depends on the sports. For swimming is like once a week in sem 1 for 2h then ihg period can be 2-3 times. Personally went in as a recreational swimmer. I think as long as you meet the cut, you can go in liao! so, just try and it’s up to them whether they accept u or not 

cultural- heard some frens who went in without bg. same as sports, as long as you meet the cut, can alr! so yeah same just try. it’s not called a hall of opportunities for no reason! 

so yeah i think you’d be able to find stg that suits ur interest or bg! 

there will be orientation! i didn’t attend the ec also but yeah still made some frens. for me, every 4 people (iirc) in my og stay in the same floor! also heard of some ogs that have people scattered all around rh but yeah still can make frens with the ppl in ur floor or ur cca or block events like orientation programmes by the block, mooncake festival and halloween also! o ya there will be hall events to make friends also like night cycling, brotheRHs and sisteRHs event (specifically for making friends). just be nice and i think u’ll defo find ur own tribe haha if u feel intimidated or wtv by hall life or sch or anything, there’s this paRHtnership programme which matches u with a senior that best suits ur needs. there will also be cca showcase during orientation and a cca fair in around week 3.

btw this was what happened last year so not sure how things will change ahaha

Sup! Welcome to RH mate. I'd say most barrier of entry for CCAs in RH is comparatively low so no pressure on joining the CCAs, in fact it's more about choosing the CCAs that you think you will enjoy. However, performance CCA that involves instruments expects a certain level of skill because you are expected to perform quite quickly into the semester, there won't be enough time to train you up if you've never touched the instrument before. Besides sports and culture you can consider joining committee / media CCAs to pick up other skill sets too!

No worries on making friend, some of your closest friends in hall are found through orientation camp / neighbour / CCAs. Don't worry and enjoy the experience! See you when you're here!!

RC4 does have culture but in the same time its chill, you are not forced to do anything

Again, that depends alot on your batchmates, who are you hanging out with and how much do you wanna be involved

Hi im from raffles. I feel like if u want a second year stay u inevitably need to work harder to accumulate points to stay since there are less spots compared to other halls since rh is the smallest. However, i think if you are strategic with ur ccas and ur commitment, you may be able to get enough points to stay. I had a friend who only had 4 ccas but managed to get a stay and select a good room due to one if his cca being media and him being strategic about what events he took.  However, I think if you want to find a balance it definitely depends on ur boundaries and priorities. There is a lot of choices and opportunities but you dont have to take every single one of them. I second the kampung vibes tho feels very homely to me. U can pm me for more info !

Not from RC4 but one of the other RCs, I would say RCs at this point are really not considered new already, most of them have a culture of some sorts (although then again this is still heavily dependent on every individual batch of students), so if you have friends and like the place just go ahead, same for RH as well
0.030194805194805194

General observation:
RCs: make smart and gd friends
Halls: finding a soulmate

From what I see in my hall friends, rls with others might get toxic due to hall commitments and rankings. Might appear fun and friendly on outside but don't expect to meet alot of close friends in hall. But because of this somewhat harsh environment, if someone is still nice to you dispite all this, he/she probly the one for u (saw too many success stories)

RCs just chill, and the fact u gotten into RC means u r somewhat ok in life (the profs got confidence in u). Ur constantly surrounded by scholars and fch people, which pressure u to be as gd as them. I found some of my closest friends here, and even gotten a referral to TikTok from them so, yeah people here generally quite successful.

Y1 currently staying in raffles hall. Raffles hall has alot of events to attend every week which are really fun to attend with friends. You are really here for the experience so ppl who like to try new things will have a lot of fun here. As for Arts I think the performances are good. You can follow the social media accounts to get a better understanding of the events.

Walk through the car park behind RH bus stop and follow the stairs up. U will see Temasek Laboratory (T-Lab), walk behind it, to the right u will see EA block and to the left up the hill is E4 or sth. 

Or u just follow other people.

Ok thanks, will try!

If you see the above few, student open has a number of common carparks. The differences are: 3 has CP10 (S17) in addition and 4 has CP 1/2A (Eng) in additon. These two often have balloting too. Unless you have classes in either science or engineering regularly, no point getting.
The main benefit of taking 2- covered is Utown parking, but its $30 more. Unless you have classes at UTown regularly, also no point.
Most people thus just buy the standard student open. As a SoC student, likely you'll park at CP11 and CP12B mostly so standard student open should be good enough for you.
Note ya that NUS season is a monthly thing, so you can choose to only buy for months you're in school (for example dont buy for Nov and Dec by simply not paying)

Hi, I am a life science student. Which one should I apply for? Thank you.

Science students bascially only have one good option- try and ballot for the CP10 season. Used to be quite difficult, not sure if its gotten easier recently. Do note that the system may not be updated, and S17 may still be known as COM1. But so long as its CP10 you should just try. If you can't get CP10 season, you have 2 choices- either parked at capped parking in UCC and take the ISB, or buy regular season (which wont run out), and park at SRC or at KE7 hall and walk/ take ISB.

congrats on the offer! I know a lot of 21+ / y3 & 4 hall students actually, you don't really notice people's ages often imo (I often forget guys are 2 years older)?

Hi! It is ok for you to not attend KEWOC, because the people attending KEWOC is not the whole hall. Don't worry you won't be lonely when you move in, the seniors from every block are very friendly and soon you will fit in. I have had friends who didn't join KEWOC or KE Rag/Flag and ended up being like the most popular freshies in my block because of how friendly they are.

Also, most of the time, nobody know each other, I came into hall knowing nobody and left knowing everybody. In addition, the JC guys definitely don't know most of the people, except maybe the seniors if they are lucky because of NS so everyone is on same starting ground. Not sure about JC girls but most of the time everyone come from different backgrounds.

ooh that's gd to know!! Do you know if the freshies would be in the same block/neighbours with other freshies?

Most of the time freshies neighbours would be freshies because the seniors chose their room nearby their own friends so the higher floors you would see the entire floor occupied by seniors.

I also got late offer for UTR before too after appeal unsuccessful 

This was after my year 2

This time round the late offer came earlier before my PGP late offer before that

In fact my UTR late offer came just before the sem started 

But in the end the offer lapsed and they probably gave the offer to another student and that’s because my parents were unwilling to pay the rather exorbitant UTR rates lol

A caveat was that my UTR late offer was when NUS still did not take in exchange students for awhile because of covid  

I only applied residence before.

1. I stay 1.5hrs away from NUS
2. Liked best: Convenience, Socializing. Least: Commitment if staying subsequent years
3. From the start, 2nd sem onwards it's less vibrant because most sports CCAs usually stand down after IHG. Also most of the time, people would grind harder for sem 2. For M1s, the 1st 2 CAs aren't too bad, but the 3rd is more brutal. Also it may be a little bit harder to fit in for 2nd term onwards because everyone already know each other.
4. Manage your time wisely
5. For me, it didn't. I already made friends during FOPs prior to hall and made friends during the sem itself so the hall is a plus. However, a few of my med friends feel that they are closer to their housemates than hall due to how long they spend together for lessons.
6. KE7. Cuz I'm from KE so I'm biased. For practicality, KE is the best for med students because you could literally walk over to med from KE if you do not wish to take the bus. Most med/nurse/dent/pharm students that stay in hall are from KE (weird coincidence but probably because of geographical proximity.

As someone who stayed in sheares this year and is moving out next yr, you should know that you will only enjoy sheares if you are a certain type of person. If you are in a major requiring a lot of work, you can often feel guilty for saying no to activities and feel left out of the culture. 
There is also some peer pressure to do stuff, so join if you're willing to do that. Personally I hated being pressured. 
If I were to join NUS again, I would choose a more chill hall like Eusoff or Temasek.
0.0026785714285714303

very different cultures, i think.

can only speak for RC4 but generally vibe of RC4 (and RCs in general?) is that ppl's priority are more on academics. hence why sometimes RC is said to be more snooze compared to halls.

could be a better fit if your major is more workload heavy. generally people are chill and don't really pressure you to go do things if you're busy or not really keen.
0.17416666666666666

rc4 you can choose to be laid back if you want but  it has one of the more vibrant bunch of interest groups and the admin is really quite dedicated to helping maintain this imo
0.21666666666666667

From Temasek, and am going to move out this year as well. It’s the same in TH, sadly. If you don’t fit in, you’re just going to be ostracized.
-0.033333333333333326

1. RC4 is divided into houses, which consists of 3 floors each. So 1 female + 1 male + 1 mixed. Culture is within the house, so there's no diff between single/mixed floors. Female floor tends to be pretty quiet since most girls are phantoms. Guy floor tends to have a lot of shit happening cause NS culture carry over and guys dgaf (more fun imo). Mixed floor more reserved cause of gender gap, and also cause the prof stays on that level. 

2. Depends on your friends, but most people like drinking and most orientation groups continue to drink throughout the sem/go out together + house drinking outings.

3. No idea, I'm from Engin.

4. Corridor rooms are along the corridors and have to share toilets. Toilet cleanliness may vary based on your floor mates. Suite rooms are 6 rooms to one suite, with shared suite toilet. Tends to be cleaner and way nearer to rooms. No, you don't have to clean the toilet. Corridor rooms obviously see more activity because people walk past, and people tend to knock on your door more to call your for mahjong/drinks/games/food/etc. 

5. Yes. Leave by 11pm.
0.17575757575757578

1. not much difference, and also rc4 is far from rabz haha. anyways, if you are phantom you will be phantom no matter what, and otherwise house activities usually jio the entire house so you're invited no matter where you stay. however, one main difference is the facility on the floors, which is meant to be shared within the house. girls floor = study room, guys floor = pantry, mixed floor = laundry. so depending on which one you want to use the most, staying closer to that might save a TINY bit of time, otherwise just need walk 1 or 2 flights of stairs which is fine imo. 
2. depends on house, but quite tame for the most part. also cos got prof living on the mixed floor, and they walk around sometimes, so people end up having to be quite discrete about it (either party in room, suite, or take risk in lounge). to be clear, there is drinking and all but its just voluntary and usually within friend/og cliques kind of thing.
3. probably around 30mins. 10 mins walk to bus stop, wait bus 5 mins, D1 takes about 10 mins to reach biz, walk about 5 mins.
4. stay corridor and thank me later. socialisation no diff. noise level really depend on luck and who is living beside you. suite has the potential to be quite messy/dirty if your suite mates are not clean.
5. by right, need leave by 11pm? and i think you need open door or what when they're here. but nobody follows that. most ppl in rc4 don't rly care if you bring you friends/gf/bf and stay overnight even as long as you don't be a nuisance.
0.10496031746031748

Answering the 3rd question since you answered the rest:

The walk from RC4 to the bus stop is around 8-10 mins for me. The bus ride itself (D1 if there are no changes) doesn’t actually take that long (5-8 mins I think). 

The bus usually comes in around 10 minute intervals, and you’d want around 5 mins to walk from the biz bus stops (com2/biz2/as5) to your class. 

Therefore, I usually leave RC4 around 30 mins before class starts, and it has worked out for me so far.
-0.07500000000000001

adding on to 4.

cleanliness of suite rlly depends on ur suitemates. some suites have super cluttered living rooms (because some committees/IGs keep their equipment with members with suites). also suite toilets are cleaned twice a week, whereas corridor toilets are cleaned mon-fri. some suitemates can be quite irresponsible, doing stupid things like washing their lunchboxes in the toilet (coz the pantry is far away) and clogging the sink 

personally, i prefer corridor as u are less affected by your peers' poor housekeeping skills.

RC4 does have culture but in the same time its chill, you are not forced to do anything

Hi im from raffles. I feel like if u want a second year stay u inevitably need to work harder to accumulate points to stay since there are less spots compared to other halls since rh is the smallest. However, i think if you are strategic with ur ccas and ur commitment, you may be able to get enough points to stay. I had a friend who only had 4 ccas but managed to get a stay and select a good room due to one if his cca being media and him being strategic about what events he took.  However, I think if you want to find a balance it definitely depends on ur boundaries and priorities. There is a lot of choices and opportunities but you dont have to take every single one of them. I second the kampung vibes tho feels very homely to me. U can pm me for more info !
0.09579365079365079

Not from RC4 but one of the other RCs, I would say RCs at this point are really not considered new already, most of them have a culture of some sorts (although then again this is still heavily dependent on every individual batch of students), so if you have friends and like the place just go ahead, same for RH as well
0.030194805194805194

General observation:
RCs: make smart and gd friends
Halls: finding a soulmate

From what I see in my hall friends, rls with others might get toxic due to hall commitments and rankings. Might appear fun and friendly on outside but don't expect to meet alot of close friends in hall. But because of this somewhat harsh environment, if someone is still nice to you dispite all this, he/she probly the one for u (saw too many success stories)

RCs just chill, and the fact u gotten into RC means u r somewhat ok in life (the profs got confidence in u). Ur constantly surrounded by scholars and fch people, which pressure u to be as gd as them. I found some of my closest friends here, and even gotten a referral to TikTok from them so, yeah people here generally quite successful.

3. If you must choose to become an appliance in the kitchen, what would it be & why?
4. If you had to spend the rest of your life on an deserted island, and can only bring 2 people/items along, who/what would it be?

Also, it was an individual interview and my interviewer was Dr Balakrishnan who was really friendly and nice, free to dm if u still have questions!

the only big one you might have some trouble with is the IEM writing module, but worst case you can always exercise your s/u option so the result of that module can be negated
-0.3

I am not as strong in my language too but the writing mod - IEM (of which you only need to take one now ) is quite manageable.  My advice is to go in with an open mind. I used my IEM as a chance for me to improve my writing skills and given the smaller class size, the prof will be there to guide you so don't worry :) . In terms of the Junior Seminar, it is a pass/fail so does not really matter, just go have fun ahaha. For Senior Seminars, I can't really speak of them since I have not taken them yet but from what I see from my friends in RC4, you guys are much more focused on the systems thinking part than writing so don't worry so much :)

if its a year long GEN mod, could i take a LOA/exchange sem in between?  


So like Y3S1: GEN (First half)  
Y3S2: GEN (SEP/LOA)  
Y4S1: GEN (Second Half)

Hi. If I am not wrong, there's a group project need to be submitted,right?

Can we find our own friends to form as a group?

I'm quite sure CHS students can choose the GEN-coded modules, similar to how most CHS students can choose GEI1001, GEI1002, or GEA1000 to fulfil the respective Gen Ed pillars

If u want to double confirm, maybe can drop ASKCHS an email?

usually JA and IEM are cleared in Y1, which sem of year1 depends on what the RC randomly allocates u,,, some ppl appeal to take 1 SA in y1s2 bcos they want to s/u the SA… whether u wan to s/u rc mods rlly depends on ur forte but for writing mods usually fass kids tend to do better so non-fass kids may consider s/u-ing
-0.13999999999999999

You don't have an option of which mods you want to do. You're assigned either JS/IEM in Sem 1, then whichever you haven't done yet in Sem 2.

It's common for people doing IEM in Sem 2 to do it alongside your SS as well, since you've cleared the prerequisite by doing your JS in Sem 1.

JS is CSCU (pass/fail), so you don't need to SU it.
-0.3

U can also choose to clear more than 1 RC modules in sem 2 to make use of your SUs
Just wait for email, the emails regarding modules and bidding for RC modules is very detailed and easy to follow
0.38833333333333336

Usually for your 1st sem depends also whether you have cleared your QET and its subsequent modules (depending on your results). If you have cleared QET you can be randomly allocated IEM/JS.

\*Btw, I'm not sure what JA is, I assume you are talking about the JS/SS

My best guess is around 30% to 40%. There simply is a lack of supply of housing on campus even for local students. 

The best way to improve your chances as an exchange student is to adamantly keep emailing NUS housing services to get a spot early. Or get recommendations of which housing to apply for from your past seniors that got campus accommodation in NUS.

if u want to have a subscribed meal plan, rc seem to be a good option! heard that the food/rooms are nice and we do have quite many exchange students staying there. and if u are tired of the rc food, ull be able to reach the utown canteens (fine food & flavours) within 3 mins :)
0.42738095238095236

Student Residences:UTR:-apartment style, u live with 3 other, have a kitchen (with no induction), so u can cook at ur own risk.- A lot of exchangers- Share a toilet with 3 other ppl only- No meal plan and a very mid social life (my experience) as a lot of masters and phd students- Convenient location

PGPR:- Single room (come in diff types eg. ac and non-ac)- Share toilet with your floor- Some of the houses (lighthouse and pioneer house) are newly renovated- No meal plan

RC:- Single room- Share toilet with your floor- Meal Plan included- Good social life and interest groups within the residence- Little exchangers compared to PGPR and UTR- Convenient location

I think RC for you is the best, however they are very picky and they have a seperate application so u need to apply early and there is no guarantee that they will offer you. UTR and PGPR are rather "easier" to get for exchangers

Hope you have fun at NUS :)  


Edit: Idk much abt halls but each one has its own culture and its own pros and cons from what I heard.

Jumping on the train to recommend RCs! Especially if you’re hoping to make some connections while here, exchange students seem to have an easier time making connections (whether with other exchangers or locals) in RCs due to there being more activities and such.

UTown Residences is generally more 'modern'. The area where it is in (University Town) is more lively, with events held at the Town Green (open area just opposite UTown Residences) as well as at the Stephen Riady Centre (multipurpose building with canteens, lecture theatres, sports hall, gyms, etc.). The downside is that it is usually more expensive (both in terms of food in the canteens and the space itself).

PGP is somewhat older, but many of the rooms have recently been renovated. So, the facade/exterior may look old, but the rooms are nice and new, and some are even more spacious than the ones in UTown (comparing a similar room type). The thing is that it is that the area is more quiet in the evenings (which may both good and bad, depending on what you like). Accessibility wise, PGP is generally closer to everywhere on the campus (it is served by 2 internal bus stops).

And, yes, if you have the chance to, I actually would recommend staying at the residential colleges/halls for a more 'complete' experience! It is common to have incoming exchange students staying in those RCs/halls.

Hi! Thank you for your helpful answer! Do you recommend any halls to stay in? Also, just to make sure, the halls have shared bathroom on each floor right? I also heard that halls are harder to get into because they are reserved for freshies and seniors that participated, so I'm not sure if I should rank them as my first choice or not to secure housing :(

Hi!

Halls-wise, I'm not very sure. I stayed at an RC. But, if you do, as a matter of fact, the RCs in UTown (CAPT/Tembusu/RC4/Cinammon/NUS College) generally have newer buildings, as compared to the Ridge View Residential College (RVRC).

They usually have some rooms specifically allotted for exchangers, but I'm not sure how many it is in absolute numbers, and thus, how competitive it is.

hi! i stayed in a residential college last semester, and yes, exchange students can stay there! met so many exchange students in my RC, both staying for 1 sem and 1 full year too.

i may be a bit biased but i would say RC might be a great option. rooms are pretty spacious for 1 person, amenities in the University Town are easily accessible, and RCs usually have their own programmes where you can meet new people and make friends too. and you're not forced to join all, just choose the ones you're interested in :)
0.30511363636363636

Staying in RC now, my one is called Tembusu, while comparing to other halls like PGP or UTR, PGP rooms are newer but the area is just pretty much just blocks and blocks of rooms, canteen isn't amazing but a lof of them do have AC rooms. UTR rooms seems quite cool with the suite setup as well as closer to all the utown stuff, the room itself is pretty much to the same as the one I have. My room has no AC and it's inside a suite of 6 but we only have 4 this sem, getting used to the no AC life and pretty happy to see the community culture here. Some of the special points of RCs compare to other halls may be: easier to get access to mailboxes and parcels, having the breakfast and dinner provided (though I haven't eaten the food that much as it really isn't that impressive), being closer to the whole UTown area, having the gym and PC commons close by. Overall I would actually prefer RC/ UTR over PGP, and PGP is defintely better than the halls I've not mentioned.
0.2582706766917293

Depends on what you are looking for

PGPR/UTown (I suppose UTown Residence) is like apartment, or, it is (much) more quiet. There are social activities, once in a while, but no regular CCAs or extracurricular activities available.

Residential Colleges/Halls of Residences are much more lively, with organized CCAs, and more regular events. Most RCs have newer buildings (except for Ridge View RC), so room wise, it's newer in style, but size, I doubt that it would be bigger/smaller in either accommodation types.

Just go attend their camps if possible. Usually will give you a reality check if the culture even suits you in the first place. I’m not too sure if it is the epitome of Uni experience but the reality is that it is not as happening as you think it is. The amount of CCAs that you have to hold and the committee work that you have to do gets draining once your assignments start to pile up. From my understanding, you don’t have to be popular to get in. Just don’t be too hung up on it lol it is really not a big deal, most of the times there aren’t much activities except for block events which gets boring overtime.

Was Y3 with little to none CCA achievements, applied for Hall, got rejected. Went to appeal, wrote a heartwrenching story about how it was my last chance to experience hall life in university and somehow got a single room no aircon in one of the hardest halls to get into, no interview required. Before this I tried applying once in Y1 and got rejected/offered a residence I didn’t want to go to so I was incredibly surprised I actually got a place lol.

So yes, it is possible. Idk how I managed to get it, witchcraft aside (and I didn’t attend any CCAs at all during my time in the hall lmao), so my guess is just sound like you are very enthu about staying in hall in your application. Good luck!

That’s not exactly the case in recent years, based on my experience from the past few years, you still do need a decent portfolio as the hall admission committee has to filter through a ton of applicants and it’s easy to just ignore/overlook those without.

Ahh thanks for the insights. I guess I have a skewed perception of hall life because all I have heard abt are the good things abt halls and how you get to mingle and socialize etc.

Maybe it's just me wanting to come out of my shell to really experience life/socialize which is why I have that perception.

With that said, I would definitely attend the camps but it just kinda feels demoralising knowing that the chances are so minuscule but at least its btr than nth🤡

My personal experience is you should sign up for biz ad and varsity CCAs and committees if you want to socialise. Looking at your background, you likely will face trouble getting Hall CCAs even if you get in. In the halls, the committees are extremely difficult to get in, you need to have connections and sports CCAs need you have to have a certain level for you to get in. If you do not have any experience even playing sports recreationally or be physically fit, you will find it hard to even get in. 

My best advice is to just go to the camp, try to avoid Temasek, Sheares, KR. If you don’t have any background, you will struggle a lot to even get CCAs to be very frank. Just see if you like the culture. If you can bond with others well, you will most likely get a spot in the hall.

Hi! Not from RVRC but I’m from NUSC. NUS College (or NUSC) is a separate honours programme under NUS which has its own curriculum that replaces the GE pillars. It’s a fairly intensive 4 year programme compared to the other RC’s 2 year programmes.

NUS College is also a residential programme, where students can expect 3-4 years or guaranteed stay on campus. We’re housed in Cinnamon College, and will eventually encompass the West Wing RCs too, or what is currently Yale-NUS.
0.29374999999999996

hey! yes, rvrc and utcp both helps replace certain modules. however, the modules offered on rvrc and utcp side are different in terms of content & teaching style. with the lift of covid restrictions this year, rvrc will be offering several modules that enables you to go overseas (within the semester)!

if you're keen to look at the different modules offered by rvrc & utcp, you can go on nusmods.com & search "rv" coded modules (eg. rvc/rvx/rvn) or "utc" coded modules (eg. utc), or go to our website! it should be noted that there's more modules coded "utc" as they're shared modules across tembusu, capt & rc4 :)

aside from differences in modules, rvrc differs from the other nus residential colleges (eg. capt, rc4, nusc, tembusu) in terms its primary focus/values, as well as culture/people. rvrc is aimed towards inculcating workplace readiness and sustainability in its residents.

in terms of the differences between rvrc & hall, these are some of the key differences:
1. rvrc offers an academic curriculum (16mc in total, 4x4mc that could cover your common curriculum - unless you study dentistry, law, medicine, etc.).

halls do not have academic curriculum.

2. rvrc offers 2 years of guranteed stay. you can apply for further stay through its senior retention programme through various routes (eg. teaching assistant, residential assistant, student leader, peer supporter, etc.).

halls offers 1 year of guranteed stay. you can apply for further stay beyond your first year, but this is subjected to if you have accumulated enough cca points / have relationship or ties with the hall JCRC for them to put you in reserve list for another year of stay.

3. rvrc does not have mandated CCAs. you're encouraged to go for interest groups activities, and it spans a much wider range compared to hall iirc! a lot more chance to do things like pottery, trips to pulau ubin, reforesting, museums, kayaking in my opinion. it's a good space to explore and learn more things because these events are extremely subsidised, most of the time you don't have to pay at all, or at most it's a small amount below $10.

i've never stayed in a hall before, but i think there are lesser chances to go out of hall for exploratory events like this. halls have CCAs, and you have to go to a specific number of CCAs to retain enough points for a further stay. however, if you're looking to stay only for 1 year, then CCAs shouldn't be a concern for you!

4. culture of people. i think the energy is different for rvrc & halls. i think arguably this is one of the biggest deciding factor for people between applying for rc & hall all the time. i wanted a more laidback lifestyle while being able to do & partake in what i want + have time outside of school & rc, hence rc was a very natural choice for me. i enjoy the academic programmes within rvrc as well, because with the smaller classroom size compared to regular common curriculum modules, i'm able to participate & delve into the topic more!

5. location -- rvrc is very centralised in nus and you can walk to most faculties through short-cuts within 10-15 minutes. most halls (excluding raffles hall) are located at specific faculties that isn't very centralised.

6. better meal plans! (comes at a higher cost) both rvrc and hall has compulsory meal plans, but rvrc meal plans offers more variety.

a lot more differences, but these are the few main ones. let me know if you'd like to ask anything else!
0.17332101806239741

Every accommodation in NUS has a competitive element attached in terms of getting admission. RVRC is no different. As long as you are willing to expand your horizons, learn new things and make new friends, you are good to go. Of course, you must be interested to read the unique RVRC modules as well as participate in College activities at least occasionally. If you are clear that you want to go through the two year RVRC programme in addition to contributing to the College with your skills and expertise, you are all set.
0.14524793388429752

hey hope this response isnt too late!

your chances of getting into any form of accomodation on campus is actually the best as an incoming year 1! however, you should note that you can RC & Halls takes in mostly year 1s, and it is extremely difficult you to get into these 2 later on unless you have connections with the main committee in charge of these. it's extremely rare. houses & residences (eg. UTown residences) however, you can apply for them anytime! however priority for UTR are given to people who are part of NUSSU / Exco hence id say that its easier to get residences after contributing to the school for a year or so.

Thank you for the information on NUSC! And yes, RVRC is separate from UTCP with our own unique programme. Feel free to ask if you have more questions:)

ooh icic! i’m definitely considering applying to an rc if iw to stay in nus, i was just curious abt why rvrc isn’t in the utcp when it seems v similar to the other rcs, thank you for answering! could i also ask abt the application, i’ve heard that it opens frm mar-apr but that’s most prob bfr we get any offer frm nus at all so do we just apply? and does the course we’re actually offered frm nus matter in the application? (eg rc has a quota for students frm chs/cde etc or maybe rc is more inclined towards a certain course due to how compatible it is w the ge)

hey hope this response isnt too late!

your chances of getting into any form of accomodation on campus is actually the best as an incoming year 1! however, you should note that you can RC & Halls takes in mostly year 1s, and it is extremely difficult you to get into these 2 later on unless you have connections with the main committee in charge of these. it's extremely rare. houses & residences (eg. UTown residences) however, you can apply for them anytime! however priority for UTR are given to people who are part of NUSSU / Exco hence id say that its easier to get residences after contributing to the school for a year or so.

If your interests, motivation aligns that with RC and you don't mind taking the academic modules, i do feel like your safest bet to secure stay would be an RC!

> why rvrc isn’t in the utcp when it seems v similar to the other rcs

The UTown College Program involves the RCs in UTown - RVRC is situated right beside USC/UHC. We do have slightly different courses than the other RCs, more geared towards exploring the world around us or focusing more on workplace readiness. Feel free to read more about them here: https://rvrc.nus.edu.sg/rvrc-programme/rvrc-courses/

> but that’s most prob bfr we get any offer frm nus at all so do we just apply

Yep - apply earlier! Your interviewers will be aware this is a possibility.

> course we’re actually offered frm nus matter in the application?

I wouldn't say so, the residents are pretty fairly distributed in their choice of major. Applicants are evaluated holistically, through their essay and interview. Hop by RVRC on the Open Day this Saturday to find out more about this!
0.2401785714285714

more than happy to be able to help you! rvrc isn't included in utcp presumably because we are not located in utown! (or that's what i speculate, because our classrooms are within the rc grounds as well).

also with regards to the second question, just apply when you can before the deadline like what they said! i think all housing application for year 1s on nus portal are quite early that some potential freshies wouldn't know if they are accepted yet but it doesn't matter as they'll still interview you for the housing application (interviews at this point are not contingent to your nus study offer)! only your final housing offer will be contingent to if you have an offer to pursue a bachelors degree under nus, but usually you'd have gotten your study offer at this point in time (iirc i got my study offer in march, and got rvrc housing offer in late may-june!)

i think the only quota the rc has is how many residents it can take in for a batch (280 for rvrc iirc), but this quota is not major specific! rvrc residents' majors are quite diverse in nature as well, so i do feel like major / choice of study isn't an issue :p hope your application goes well!! if you have some time this saturday, you could come down for NUS open house! all the rc booths will be located at university town (UTown), and faculty booths are around as well jic you have any enquiries!

i lived in pgpr type c (non renovated, no aircon) in ay21/22. tbh the hygiene condition is not as bad as it seems, for me i think is q clean. cleaners will clean everyday, including wkends. just that sometimes there might be clogged toilets lol

theres pick&go, a fully automated stall which means you can get snacks as early/as late as you want. supersnacks (sells waffles, burgers etc) opens until 2am if iirc. canteen also opens everyday (including hols) so its pretty convenient

if you are sick of the food in pgpr, you can just go to kr mrt or utown 

theres also study rms at lvl 1 or basement and i used to go there and study

altho there might be lesser choices for food as compared to staying in utown, an advantage for staying in pgpr is that its rly close to the mrt, you can just walk there. if you stay at utown or other places, you needa wait for the bus and sometimes you cant even get on it cos its damn crowded. you also dont hv to wait for 20-30min for the bus to get to mrt during wkends

and when you do the laundry you hv to make sure you get down on time cos during peak period ppl just take out your clothes and leave it on top of the washing machine

a thing that i hate staying there is that it gets rly hot and stuffy and the fan doesnt do much work. but i think it wont be a prob for you since you are staying in an air con rm

overall i think staying in pgpr has been overall q a gd experience for me and i recommend staying there
if you stay at other places, you still hv to travel around and its much more expensive, must as well stay on campus
-0.003932178932178926

Thanks for a really informative answer, super helpful! One last question, do you know if travel to utown is easy, since some friends got accommodation there, and student activities if there are any? Saw that the bus system stops around 23:00, would I be limited by that?
0.19642857142857142

yep travelling to utown is easy since theres a direct bus route, but theres only 1 bus route (d2)

you can download the nus next bus app for bus timings and to plan your route ard nus

for student activities im not vry sure cos i didnt take part in them myself lol. but if the place you hv your activity is not that far away from pgpr, you can consider walking

however, i do know that those taking part in sports often train till rly late (i used to hv a grp member who had trainings from 7-9 or 9-11). but i think differs for different interest grps also, you can try searching online/intstagram or asking on reddit abt the one you are interested in

oh yes and btw for pgpr canteen, i recommend mala hotpot (is spicy but you can choose the least spiciest if youre), its prob the best mala in nus. the western food is also rly nice but the waiting time can be q long

feel free to ask if you hv anymore questions!!

> but then I saw all the rules like no visitors after 9pm and all, which seems a bit absurd to me coming from North America where we’re free to do what we want.

There are many figures of speech that apply here:

- *'under the table'*
- *'don't ask, don't tell'*

 ... You get what I mean, I hope. Keep your noise levels down (helps if you keep the windows closed), don't be *too* boisterous, and you can get away with many things that are 'against the rules'. I've had roommates who invited their girlfriends over for many a night-time cavort, and never did get caught. 

> is it still worth it over renting an apartment with other exchange students off-campus?

Rental prices in Singapore are sky-high right now. If you already have a room at UTown, don't throw it away because of a few tight rules (that you can bend anyway).

If you see the above few, student open has a number of common carparks. The differences are: 3 has CP10 (S17) in addition and 4 has CP 1/2A (Eng) in additon. These two often have balloting too. Unless you have classes in either science or engineering regularly, no point getting.
The main benefit of taking 2- covered is Utown parking, but its $30 more. Unless you have classes at UTown regularly, also no point.
Most people thus just buy the standard student open. As a SoC student, likely you'll park at CP11 and CP12B mostly so standard student open should be good enough for you.
Note ya that NUS season is a monthly thing, so you can choose to only buy for months you're in school (for example dont buy for Nov and Dec by simply not paying)

Hi, I am a life science student. Which one should I apply for? Thank you.

Science students bascially only have one good option- try and ballot for the CP10 season. Used to be quite difficult, not sure if its gotten easier recently. Do note that the system may not be updated, and S17 may still be known as COM1. But so long as its CP10 you should just try. If you can't get CP10 season, you have 2 choices- either parked at capped parking in UCC and take the ISB, or buy regular season (which wont run out), and park at SRC or at KE7 hall and walk/ take ISB.

1. PGPR rooms are MUCH bigger than the ones in UTR, mainly because students in PGPR are divided into individual rooms and each floor has its own toilet and pantry, while UTR is more like students are grouped into apartment suites, so the rooms are smaller as students there get to have their own living area indoors. The space in PGPR should be big enough for your luggage.

2. There is a very simple "safe box" in PGPR, it's just a passcode locked drawer in the wardrobe.

3. It's NUS, you get WiFi access everywhere.

4. The laundry in PGPR cost $1 for both washing and drying. I'm not sure about aircon as most people don't get to stay in aircon rooms anyway.

5. The toilets can get dirty if your floor mates don't care about hygiene, but toilets will be cleaned by cleaners almost every morning.

6. Rooms don't get housekeeped. You need to clean it yourself.

7. You can cook in the pantry at PGPR. UTR rooms don't have a stove fyi. It's quite common to cook.

Welcome to NUS.
0.15833333333333335

I live in UTown Residence (UTR) and i can clear up some of the things you mentioned.  


UTR is an accommodation thats full of flats that are shared by 4 students. There is a common living space, "kitchen" that has a sink, microwave and a fridge and storage area for your snacks and stuff and a bathroom and shower. Nothing more. The room itself in my opinion isnt small (subjective to the person) and there is storage area above the cupboard and below the bed. Can fit multiple suitcases easily in my opinion. There is no safety deposit box in the room. There is a NUS Student wifi that works well throughout the entire accommodation (except lifts) that you can login via your student id and password that you'll get once you matriculate.  


Each flat has one bathroom and one shower (4 people sharing one) in the case of UTR. It depends on what kind of flatmates you get honestly, as my experience with my flatmates has been positive and I never had a problem with cleanliness and maintenance of the place. Housekeeping cleans the common living spaces and bathrooms 2 times a week but your room is your responsibility.   


The culture over here is that everyone eats out for all meals of the day so cooking does not really occur. For the same reason, the kitchen does not have an induction (it is not allowed but most people bring in their own). Feel free to cook if you want but be careful not to get caught haha. PGPR however has a pantry (on each floor? not sure) where you are allowed to cook.  


Hope you have a good time in NUS :)

as y2s, many of my friends and acquaintances were rejected from Helix in round 1, so uh don’t get your hopes up and maybe have a back up plan too
0.09999999999999999

I would recommend pioneer house and light house since they are more established, so I guess they may have more events more welfare?? While Helix is new so I don’t think they will have much events
0.37272727272727274

As a current resident in PH, I would say HH is the easiest to get in out of the 3 houses. For PH, application for new residents has more priority to freshmen (from what I observed because my level is 90% freshies), and Y2/3/4s are usually returning seniors with a portfolio, so there is a higher chance for you to get rejected. As for AC/Non-AC, it is really up to luck for new residents bc returning seniors have priority for AC rooms, so by the time new residents application opens, most of the AC rooms are gone. But compared to hall, getting into PH as a returning senior is easier than hall, and the best way is to be part of a large end-of-AY event (FOC, RAG, Open day) that you actively participate in (if not you will get snitched on as a freeloader and get rejected), but I'm not sure if you want to do that bc it seems like you want to focus more on acad next sem. Location wise, PH is close to the canteen and PGP bus stop (2 min walk), but PGPR bus stop is a bit far because of the stairs.   
LH is quite new too, and the thing I like most about them is that they have a cat CCA where you basically sign up to take care of the two LH cats. Not too sure about new residents application but for returning seniors I've heard you need a certain number of recommendations from other residents to get a spot (kinda easier that PH if you made friends). Less opportunities for uni wide events compared to PH, which is considered a hall (kinda), but shouldn't be a problem for you. As for location, LH is close to PGPR bus stop and PicknGo, and the canteen is not too far as well. But heard that LH doesn't have as much budget compared to PH so welfare isn't as good as PH.  
HH will be the easiest to get in because you have no competition with seniors, only other new residents, but I still think freshies will get a priority in the application process. Either way, the portfolio shouldn't be too difficult to fill in from what I've seen (I put HH as 3rd choice for fun), so just put whatever you think is appropriate and submit, don't need to think too much. If they ask you how you are planning to contribute, just write as much as possible first then when you get in, decide how much you actually need to contribute in order to stay another year (if that's the plan). And if you are planning to stay for Y4, I think application for returning residents shouldn't be too difficult to complete as well since HH is still very much in the process of figuring out its identity. From looking at the portfolio form, it should be something like a reflection for the year type of thing for HH.
0.15128984651711927

helix would be easier i think since they don’t have an established “house identity” yet and there are no senior residents there that have reserved spots(unlike the other houses). Their “portfolio” submission is quite simple compared to the others imo.

Anyways, I don't recall seeing this cat on the NUS Catcafe social media page so I am not sure if they are taking care of it. So yea as mentioned by the others you can give NUS Catcafe a heads up about this kitty, especially since it's so shy and discreet.

I managed to feed it on some occasions last year. Very very Timid cat, approach him with extra care. It's tough to track his movements but usually moves around PGP. (LH>PH>HH area often)

If I’m not wrong, this cat is currently not being taken care of by CatCafe so it would be great to DM them on ig when u next see it. Sending them specific pics and descriptions of where u saw the kitty, and maybe checking if the cat has a clipped ear (sign that the cat has been neutered) would be really useful!

?o.O nothing wrong with caring for a stray cat,definitely okay to interact with the cat :D I remember talking to the PGP security and they feed it on some occasions, not sure if it is regular or not. But this cat is really really really timid, so you have to tame it well to gain trust when approaching it. :'D

Take the bus to CLB, alight and walk towards the lift in front of the library entrance. Once near the lift, turn right and walk all the way up the stairs, you should see some study tables. Turn left and walk along the corridor, LT14 should be one of the LTs on the left.
0.09642857142857142

LT14 should be at the level 1 walkway along AS6. NUSMods has a map here: https://nusmods.com/venues/LT14?q=lt14

I would recommend alighting at CLB!

I am currently a CL at helix House, tbh if u really wan commit u can have weekly mini level gathering with ur residence know about their stay and maybe bring the exchange student to explore sg apart from the mandatory monthly event. But if u don't wan commit then u can just do the monthly event and just ensure there is no big problem in ur level such as fighting, argument, pest infection and other stuff. It's really depends on u.

If you truly have the heart to serve the home of titans, commitment is not an issue
-0.16666666666666666

Being a cluster leader in pgpr might mean you won’t be staying in a building of your own faculty. Depending on which faculty everyone might know each other already and you’re a little bit of the odd one out.

Commitment isn’t heavy at all compared to RAs. You’re expected to host and plan events but it’s likely people won’t want to sign up. In that case you’ll have to at least get them to tell you online “I’m interested!” to meet the minimum criteria even if they don’t show. It’s for paperwork’s sake, even for the RAs who you will be working together with.

Other than that it’s OK. You also won’t get access to A/C rooms (unless they’ve changed the options post renovations) so consider getting a portable A/C on your own. 

To sum it up, PGPR cluster leader might expose you to less social life compared to if you were to enter PGPR as a regular dorm user. If you just want a quiet and peaceful dorm life with your own space at a discounted rate, it’s pretty decent. They even have an automated mart nearby :)

hi! i stayed in a residential college last semester, and yes, exchange students can stay there! met so many exchange students in my RC, both staying for 1 sem and 1 full year too.

i may be a bit biased but i would say RC might be a great option. rooms are pretty spacious for 1 person, amenities in the University Town are easily accessible, and RCs usually have their own programmes where you can meet new people and make friends too. and you're not forced to join all, just choose the ones you're interested in :)
0.30511363636363636

Staying in RC now, my one is called Tembusu, while comparing to other halls like PGP or UTR, PGP rooms are newer but the area is just pretty much just blocks and blocks of rooms, canteen isn't amazing but a lof of them do have AC rooms. UTR rooms seems quite cool with the suite setup as well as closer to all the utown stuff, the room itself is pretty much to the same as the one I have. My room has no AC and it's inside a suite of 6 but we only have 4 this sem, getting used to the no AC life and pretty happy to see the community culture here. Some of the special points of RCs compare to other halls may be: easier to get access to mailboxes and parcels, having the breakfast and dinner provided (though I haven't eaten the food that much as it really isn't that impressive), being closer to the whole UTown area, having the gym and PC commons close by. Overall I would actually prefer RC/ UTR over PGP, and PGP is defintely better than the halls I've not mentioned.
0.2582706766917293

Depends on what you are looking for

PGPR/UTown (I suppose UTown Residence) is like apartment, or, it is (much) more quiet. There are social activities, once in a while, but no regular CCAs or extracurricular activities available.

Residential Colleges/Halls of Residences are much more lively, with organized CCAs, and more regular events. Most RCs have newer buildings (except for Ridge View RC), so room wise, it's newer in style, but size, I doubt that it would be bigger/smaller in either accommodation types.

Are the sources recent, and is the equipment from these sources capable enough?

I suspect the 200+ Mbps connection is already there. Whether you can max that out depends on how you are connected(i.e WiFi vs Ethernet) and how many others are doing bandwidth-heavy/-reliant tasks at that point in time.


Don't think NUS would allow an external connection in any form when they already have one which they have control of. How did you get this idea?
0.13999999999999999

There’s gigabit internet if u connect through ethernet, I have got 900+ mbps at late night but usually its around 300 mbps. Btw I stay in pgp.

Edit: wifi is usually around 80-100 mbps in my room, has been around this in the last 2 years I have lived across different blocks.
-0.16

The plug-n-play LAN port in your room should give you superb internet speed; there's no need to subscribe to anything. The wifi is the one that has connectivity problems from time-to-time.

you definitely can't subscribe to your own connection as the rooms won't be wired up with fibre TP's

I learned this from some ex-students who studied there in 2018. My partner is starting her doctoral studies there and I plan to visit her frequently, probably live with her for s month or so. I work remote and require high bandwidth and I think it is not apporpriate to hog student bandwidth for work.

She wants to live in PGPR so moving out is not an option. Just evaluating my options here.

Edit: Thank you very much for giving your time to respond.

Thank you again. This was very reassuring. As u/altruistic_hydrangea recommended, I will also procure a 802.11ax router with the management's permission. I think the regulations require us to request permission to use external appliances. That is what the guidelines said on various uni websites. 

This community is very helpful.
0.1

This. If wireless is slow, get your own personal 802.11ax router and connect your router to ethernet, then enjoy your newfound, blazing-fast speeds. If the ethernet port is broken, you'll just need to send in a message to management and they'll fix it in around a week or so.
0.059999999999999984

Don’t think u would be hogging bandwidth, surely not in case of ethernet. Shouldn’t really matter for wifi also as there are access points every few metres.

Hello anyone finished the application of it? I really need help figuring out the difference between 2) and 4) option, and by the way what happens if you applied vacation stay without in-room storage? They won’t just throw your stuff away right?😂
0.2

Ok from what I realise is either u store and stay or stay first then store. For example if u want stay abit longer after sem end then u cfm dw stay anymore then u store and vice versa. 

Anyways u can click on the diff option and play ard. Ur option will only be executed after u pay
0.25

The difference is whether you want to stay longer, then leave your stuff locked in the room later, or leave your stuff locked up immediately after semester 1 is over and come back to your room before the semester 2 check-in date. Am I making sense?
0.0

yea and a common practice is to share
-0.3

Nope.

In-room storage is the 'lower tier'. You apply for this if you are not going to stay inside your room, but don't want to pack up your things. As far as I know, in-room storage is usually discounted from the vacation stay rate, but you can't enter your room to retrieve/take items.

Vacation stay is the 'higher tier'. You apply for this if you are staying in your room throughout the period(s) you specified.

Sorry I don't quite get you, there's some slangs in your words I haven't learned lol. 
Anyway the point is I want to stay in the hostel just as usual during the whole winter vacation, so I guess for me is either 2）or 4）, but the explanation on the website really confused me, can you kindly offer some suggestion?

Just pick option 3 if you’re staying for the entire duration

So what that in-room storage stands for?
0.0

In-room storage just means that you can store all your items in your room. However you won’t be allowed to stay in your room because they’ll deactivate your access card. It’s usually for those who are staying on in semester 2 but don’t want the hassle to moving out entirely.
-0.125

I see. But may I ask if it's in this way, why are there still two combination of IR storage and vacation stay?
0.0

Wait, I seems to get it. So those two options are just for ppl who won't leave immediately or want to leave shortly then back after end of sem1?
0.0

I think its if the period you want storage and the period youre actually staying in is different.
0.0

So if I only select vacation stay they won't throw everything except me out of the room right lol.

Yep, select option 3 and indicate the dates as the whole duration to stay in the dorm for the whole break.

you are probably right the only thing was due to renovation some blocks can check in early others can't, anyway my doubt was solved as HAS simply wrote me I can't check in early.
